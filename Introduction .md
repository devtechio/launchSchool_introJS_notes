* JavaScript was originally LiveScript and  created by Brendan Eich in 95.
* It was made for Netscape Navigator
* For much of its history, JS was not regarded as a serious programming language.
* 2008 crucial turning point: Google's Chrome V8 high-performance JS engine.
	* allowed devs to build sophisticated browser-based apps w/performance that competed with desktop and mobile apps.
* Soon after Ryan Dahl released an open-source, cross-platform environment called Node.js, which provided a way to run JS from outside the browser. 
	* browser, server, mobile, desktop apps.
	* Meta, Twitter, Netflix, Google all use JS in their products.


## Abstraction 

* Abstraction ensures that users are far removed from what's happening 'under the hood'.
* Software engineers must understand how the software subsystems interoperate and must also concern themselves with the OS and devTools. 

Programmers operate at a lower-level abstraction by using a programming language like JS, JS gets processed by a runtime environment (engine ie. Chrome V8), which itself is a still-lower-level language like C++. The engines thus convert JS into even lower-level code until the original JS code ends up as a series of 1s and 0s that the computer can 'understand'.

There are also higher level abstractions such as libraries and frameworks like React etc. that are built on existing components without needing to know how to implement the features they provide. 

Learning javascript in depth helps you better understand frameworks, and reading and maintaining programs that use those frameworks becomes easier. 

Understanding lower levels of abstraction will help you make better use of tools with higher abstraction levels. 

Learning javascript fundamentals in depth will help in recognizing and using higher level abstractions with more granularity.
